This folder contains the binaries for comparison tools. For comparison tests, MolVec expects the following real or symlinked binary executables to be present:

1. "osra" -- OSRA 2.1.0 (may work with versions above or below, but untested)
2. "imago_console"


To add a symlink to an installed osra instance on a unix environment, use a command like the following:

```
ln -s /opt/local/osra/2.1.0/osra-bin osra
```
